# TMTools

**TMTools** is a helpfull chrome extension for Snellman's Terra Mystica moderator website. Its is designed to provide some features which are still not implemented on original website like more sound alerts and more flexible filters. Also provides some graphs and statistics to help newcomers evaluate their overall improvement on the game.

### Motivation

The main motivation for building this extension was the need to improve my gameplay. I started to see games from best players of the site and one day I saw a very interesting game from the knowed great player [Xevoc](http://terra.snellman.net/player/Xevoc), the [Petri20](http://terra.snellman.net/game/Petri20). In this game he crossed the 200VP barrier and for me that was the best that I could reach. As my objective was study only his moves I created a simple script (javascript) to filter the log. So that helped me a lot to improve my overall gameplay with [Engineers](http://www.terra-mystica-spiel.de/en/voelker.php?show=8).
